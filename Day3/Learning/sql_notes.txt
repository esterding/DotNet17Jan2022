--------------------------------------------------
advantages of stored procedure (5 points):
faster, only 1 time execution
avoided data injection
only database person will know 
--------------------------------------------------
try to create variable as less as possible

start with 'begin' and end with 'end' can start to write a simple programming in sql
declare a variable with '@', and give it a datatype. start with 'declare'
given a value to the variable start with 'set'
if using datatime(or any datatype coundnt be print), will need to 'cast' it datatype to varchar when print

'create procedure' same as 'create proc', is to create a procedure

if the stored procedure has been loaded, use 'alter procedure' to modify.

'begin tran' can 'rollback' if transactions failed. after 'commit', no rollback allowed.
all DML will rollback if 'rollback'. for safe, can make a safe point before commit, else no turn back.
'begin tran' must end with 'rollback' or 'commit'
-----------------------------------------------------
start with 'create function' to create a function
using function if required return a value, tabular
to call function, start with 'select', and fill in the function name as like table name
function cannot have print function, cannot process DML Query for a existing table

-------------------------------------------------
start with 'create trigger' to create a trigger
start with 'create trigger' > 'on' what > 'for' what> 'as' > 'begin'
trigger unable to pass parameter, need to use 'from inserted'

declare, open, fetch,close, deallocate
